## Tailscale VPN network
Tailscale is a management toolset to establish a WireGuard based VPN between multiple systems
if you want to connect to openHAB(ian) instances outside your LAN over Internet.
It'll take care to detect and open ports when you and your peers are located behind firewalls.
This makes use of the tailscale service. Don't worry, for private use it's free of charge.

## Offline installation
We now allow for deploying openHABian to destination networks without Internet connectivity.
While the optional components still require access to download, the openHABian core is
fully contained in the download image and can be installed and run without Internet.
This will also provide a failsafe installation when any of the online sources for the tools
we need to download is unavailable for whatever reason.

## Auto-backup
openHABian can automatically take daily syncs of your internal SD card to
another card in an external port. This allows for fast swapping of cards
to reduce impact of a failed SD card.
The remaining space on the external device can also be used to setup openHABian's Amanda backup system.
